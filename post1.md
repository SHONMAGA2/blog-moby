| In the beginning of *Moby-Dick*, Ishmael, the narrator, introduces himself. He gives a clear background of his restless urge to go out to sea whenever he feels depressed or trapped on land. Seeking adventure and escape, he joins a whaling voyage out of New Bedford, Massachusetts, setting the stage for the epic journey that follows. | As the novel progresses, Ishmael and his new crew settle into life aboard the whaling ship *Pequod*. We get to know Captain Ahab and his obsession with hunting a sperm whale, Moby-Dick, the creature that took his leg. The story alternates between day-to-day details of whaling life—dangers of the sea, rituals of hunting, a mix of cultures among sailors—and Ahab's growing obsession to find and kill the whale at any cost. | In the final part of the novel, Ahab finally encounters Moby-Dick. A massive, deadly chase unfolds across the open sea. Despite the crew’s efforts, Ahab’s obsession carries them to disaster. *Pequod* is destroyed by the whale, killing the crew. Ishmael, who clings to a lifeboat floating alone at sea, survives and lives to tell the story, marking the end of his adventures at sea. |
